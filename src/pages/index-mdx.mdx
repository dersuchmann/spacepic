# üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Hello, Astronaut!

Welcome to Spacepic, a photo gallery based on the official [Astro](https://astro.build/) blog starter template. This template serves as a lightweight, minimally-styled starting point for anyone looking to build a personal website, blog, or portfolio with Astro.

This template comes with a few integrations already configured in your `astro.config.mjs` file. You can customize your setup with [Astro Integrations](https://astro.build/integrations) to add tools like Tailwind, React, or Vue to your project.

For Spacepic, integrations for React, Tailwind, and MDX are already active. Additionally, you can write styles using css-in-js via the ecsstatic library. Eslint and Prettier are also ready to go. In short, this makes it possible to use React components like this counter:

<div style={{ border: '1px solid black', marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
  <Counter initialCount={0} unitSingular="album" unitPlural="albums" customColor="orange" client:load />
</div>

Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template:

- Edit this page in `src/pages/index.astro`
- Edit the site header items in `src/components/Header.astro`
- Add your name to the footer in `src/components/Footer.astro`
- Check out the included blog posts in `src/content/blog/`
- Customize the blog post page layout in `src/layouts/BlogPost.astro`

Have fun! If you get stuck, remember to [read the docs](https://docs.astro.build/) or [join us on Discord](https://astro.build/chat) to ask questions.
